# Bubble Pop
This is a bubble shooting game written in Python with a GUI.  Trigonometry and Depth-First Search are used to implement the core game logic.
## Technologies
* Python
* Pygame
## Game Rules
* User can use the left and right arrow keys to aim, and press the spacebar to launch the bubble.  
* If the bubble hits more than two bubbles of the same color, those bubbles are 'popped' and any bubble below them will be removed.  Otherwise, the newly launched bubble sticks to where it arrives.
* After every 6th shot, a wall is lowered incrementally. The goal is to clear the remaining bubbles before they reach the bottom of the screen.
