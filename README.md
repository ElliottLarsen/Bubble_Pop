# Bubble Pop

This is a bubble shooting game written in Python with a GUI using Pygame.  Trigonometry and Depth-First Search are used to implement the core game logic.
<br>

## Rules
---
- User can use the left and right arrow keys to aim, and press the spacebar to launch the bubble.  
- If the bubble hits more than two bubbles of the same color, those bubbles are 'popped' and any bubble below them will be removed.  Otherwise, the newly launched bubble sticks to where it arrives.
- After every 6th shot, a wall is lowered incrementally. The goal is to clear the remaining bubbles before they reach the bottom of the screen.

# Bubble Pop - Part VIII

After every 7th shoot, a wall is lowered.

<p align = "center">
<image src = "gifs/Part_VIII.gif" title = "Lowers the wall." width = 280 height = 450><br>
</p>
<br>


# Bubble Pop - Part VII

The user gets 7 shots per each round before the wall starts coming down.  As the last two shots are fired, the screen starts to shake.

<p align = "center">
<image src = "gifs/Part_VII.gif" title = "Shake the screen." width = 280 height = 450><br>
</p>
<br>

</p>
<br>

# Bubble Pop - Part V

When a new bubble collides with more than three bubbles of the same color, the bubbles are removed from the screen.

<p align = "center">
<image src = "gifs/Part_V.gif" title = "Bubble popped." width = 280 height = 450><br>
</p>
<br>

# Bubble Pop - Part IV

When a new bubble collides with pre-existing bubbles, the new bubble is stopped and placed on the screen.

<p align = "center">
<image src = "gifs/Part_IV.gif" title = "Bubble stops." width = 280 height = 450><br>
</p>
<br>

# Bubble Pop - Part III

A bubble of a randomly chosen color is placed on the arrow and when the spacebar on a keyboard is pressed, the bubble is launched.  If the bubble hits the wall, it rebounds.  As the bubble leaves the top of the screen, the next bubble (waiting on the left side of the arrow) is placed on the arrow.
